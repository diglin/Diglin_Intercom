```json
{
    ...
    "require": {
        "diglin/diglin_intercom":"*"
    },
    "repositories": [
	    {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "http://packages.firegento.com"
        }

    }
}

```

### Via manually
- You can copy the files from the folders of this repository to the same folders structure of your installation

### Post Installation

If you have an error 404 after install the extension and you get access to the configuration pages, do the followings:

- Clear your cache, see the menu <b>System > Cache Management</b>
- Login and logout from your backend to update the access control
- Or after installation, save again the Administrator Role to get access to the configuration page of this module. Go to your Magento Backend, then Menu <b>System > Permissions > Roles > Administrator</b> and save again this role.
- Just configure the Application ID of your account by signin into your Intercom account and get the Application ID (check the Url, it should looks like to https://app.intercom.io/a/apps/MYAPPID)
- Copy the Application ID to the configuration of the module. Follow in Magento Backend, the menu System > Configuration > Diglin > Intercom

## Customized template
If you have a customized template, check that you have <b>getChildHtml('before_body_end')</b> in files <b>/frontend/mypackage/mytemplate/template/page/1column.phtml, 2columns-left.phtml, 2columns-right.phtml, 3columns.phtml and empty.phtml</b> after <b>getChildHtml('footer')</b> Eventually you will need to copy the file <b>app/design/frontend/base/default/layout/chat.xml</b> in your layout template.
